# Node workshop

‚ùó Preview this readme if you're working locally :)

In this workshop, we'll build up a NodeJS app from the ground up and check our understanding as we go along.

Firstly, you'll need to:


### Setup steps

1. get into pairs

2. ensure someone has forked and cloned this repository

3. once you've cloned your fork - open your repository in VSCode

4. connect your local repository to the **upstream** repository

5. fetch all the branches `git fetch --all`

6. switch to the `node_review_workshop` branch! üéâ Congratulations - you're all setup and ready to go!



## Go to Level 100

In this workshop, you'll need to switch between driver and navigator throughout the different levels. In other words, you should be swapping roles around all the time so you each get a chance to type.


To start level 100, you'll need to switch to the branch `node_review_workshop_100`. You can do this using the bottom left of the VSCode interface.
 

Once you're there follow the instructions in the `readme.md`. :)
